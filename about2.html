          <h2>The Compromise</h2>
          <p>After the end of the war the allies gathered together to decide the compromise to the end of the war. The president of the united states Woodrow Wilson presented his fourteen points. Suggesting that there was a good healthy way to address the post ww1 europe, however they were twisted by the British and French into the Versailles Treaty made to punish the Germans. The Germans were presented with the full war guilt. Forced to pay off the costs of the war. A payment that would not be completed until 2010 a little less than a century to repair for the effects of WW1.

          <p>The final payment was Â£59.5 million, about $93.8 million, Germany went bankrupt in the 1920s, Der Spiegel explained, and issued bonds between 1924 and 1930 to pay off the towering debt, Germany thought U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points would provide the foundation for a peace treaty with the axis powers,  European leaders sought to stifle the nation's economic recovery, and in effect, its ability to get its army back, Restrictions were placed onto germany's army and navy, and it was porhibeted to have an air force. The Treaty of Versailles not only forced Germany to give up territories to France, Belgium, Poland, the Czechs and the League of Nations, but it also included a War Guilt Clause forcing Germany to accept responsibility for the war, thereby making it liable for the damages. </p>
